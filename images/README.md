# Image Processing

The only processing step we applied is the removal of rotation. Other techniques were tested, but they only seemed to harm accuracy.

## Usage

To preprocess the images, simply run the following script and specify the source directory containing the images and the destination directory:

```bash
python image_processing.py images_path save_path

```
